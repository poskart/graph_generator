# graph_generator
This is simple graph generation library developed to work with parallel graph algorithms on CUDA. Supports quasi-random trees, graphs, bipartite and isomoprhic graphs generation.
Graph representation is based on adjacency list according to article "Accelerating large graph algorithms on the GPU using CUDA" by Pawan Harish and P. J. Narayanan
